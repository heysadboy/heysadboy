### Welcome to my GitHub profile :bear:

I am a software developer with 2+ years of experience. I was born and raised in India and after graduating I moved to Japan for my first full-time job in 2019.

Currently, I use ReactJS, Django and AWS at my work. I have also worked with Android in the past. I have 2 apps with 10,000+ downloads on [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=sadboy&hl=en). I like making scalable and beautiful products.

I hope to make many open source projects this year and improve my skills. 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/heysadboy). Thanks for stopping by at my profile. :rose:
