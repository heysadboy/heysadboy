### Welcome to my GitHub profile

I was born and raised in India and after graduating I moved to Tokyo for my first full-time job in 2019. I lived in Hamburg for 1 year and now I live in Oslo since 2022.

Currently, I work as software developer with a focus on frontend. I have also worked with Android in the past. I have 2 apps with 10,000+ downloads on [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=heysadboy&hl=en). I like making scalable and beautiful products.

I hope to make many open source projects this year and improve my skills. 

Welcome to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/heysadboy). Thanks for stopping by at my profile.
